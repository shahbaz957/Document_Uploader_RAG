Machine Learning is a powerful branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed for every task. Instead of hardcoding rules, ML models analyze historical data to identify patterns and make predictions or decisions based on new, unseen inputs. It plays a vital role in applications ranging from spam detection, recommendation systems, and voice recognition to fraud detection, medical diagnostics, and self-driving cars. Machine learning can be broadly categorized into supervised learning, where models are trained on labeled data; unsupervised learning, which discovers hidden patterns in unlabeled data; and reinforcement learning, where an agent learns through trial and error by interacting with its environment. A typical ML workflow involves collecting and cleaning data, selecting an appropriate algorithm, training the model, evaluating its accuracy, and finally deploying it to make real-world predictions. With the growing availability of data and computational power, machine learning is transforming industries and shaping the future of automation and intelligent decision-making.
